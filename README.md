Real Estate Price Prediction App

This project is a Real Estate Price Prediction app that uses a machine learning model to predict house prices based on input features like the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, and size. The app is built using Streamlit and scikit-learn, allowing users to interact with the model through a simple web interface.

Features

	•	Predicts real estate prices based on user-provided inputs.
	•	Takes the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, and property size as inputs.
	•	Scales the inputs and applies a trained machine learning model to estimate the price.
	•	Easy-to-use web interface built with Streamlit.

The requirements.txt file should include packages like:

	•	streamlit
	•	scikit-learn
	•	joblib
